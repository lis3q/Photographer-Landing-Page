# Photographer Landing Page

This is my first landing page using Bootstrap 5. The website is a business card/landing page with 5 sections: Home, about, pricing, contact and gallery.

This project took me about 2-3 hours. I did the layout, appearance and texts myself. When creating this website, I only knew the basics of Bootstrap 5. Most of the work was copying a component from the Bootstrap documentation and pasting it into my HTML code. I had to change most things in a separate CSS file.

While creating this project, I had many failures, but I still learned a lot, including that Bootstrap is a powerful tool and reduces work time and helps automate website responsiveness.
